CouchCoach is a desktop app for sports coaches who need a quick way to keep
track of players during trials and team selection. It combines a command box
for fast keyboard use with a graphical list of player records.

## What you can do

The current version lets you:

- Add players with a name, phone number, email address, and address.
- Give players custom tags, such as a position or trial group.
- List players and find them by name.
- Edit or delete a player using their number in the displayed list.
- Clear the list when starting a new set of records.
- Save changes automatically to a local JSON file.

Player ratings and selection decisions are planned for later versions; they
are not available in the current app.

## Get started

Install Java 25, clone this repository, and run the app from the repository
root:

```bash
./gradlew run
```

Enter commands in the command box. For example:

```text
add n/Tan Wei Ming p/91234567 e/wei@example.com a/123 Clementi Road t/goalkeeper
find Tan
list
```

Type `help` to open the in-app help page. Player data is saved in
`data/addressbook.json` relative to the directory from which you run the app.

For command details, see the [User Guide](docs/UserGuide.md). For setup,
architecture, and testing information, see the
[Developer Guide](docs/DeveloperGuide.md).

## Development

Run the project checks with Java 25:

```bash
./gradlew check
```

CouchCoach is built with Java and JavaFX. It uses Gradle for builds and Jackson
for local data storage.
